# what is unix? #

- sometimes a mindset
- always something ppl will rage about

__By Salus:__
1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well
2. write programs to work togther
3. write programs to handle text streams (because that is a universal interface)

# what are gnu core utils / unix toolchain? #
- collection of tools for daily use
- build after (some aspects of) the unix principles
- avaible on most or all unix systems
- cmd \<input \>output
# big tools #

## grep ##
- find stuff
- can do regex

## make ##
- build stuff using rules
- super fancy internal rules (for e.g. c)
- touring complete
- typical "make configure install"

## sh ##
- interactive processor of commands
- unites toolchain
- cli ui (pls do not call it that xD )


## ctags ##
- parses code to find defintions
- make definition searchable
- works for most languages

## git ##
- versioning tool

## gcc ##
- compiler
- designed for c but can do lot more know

## man ##
- helpfile manager

## gdb ##
- debugger
- designed for c
- can do lot more
# unixtoolchain with vim #
- :set makeprg
- :set grepprg=rg --vimformat

## use it with the builtin tools ##
- all external commands can be replaced
- use quickfix or specify alternative format
- can be changed for performance 
- can be changed for extra features (but watchout on other maschines)

## use any tool with vim ##
- pipe output to files
- use fifo
- pipe content through commands
