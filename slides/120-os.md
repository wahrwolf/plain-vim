# Where is my cat?
## what is unix? ##

- sometimes a mindset
- always something ppl will rage about

## what are the unix principles?"
__By Salus:__
1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well
2. write programs to work togther
3. write programs to handle text streams (because that is a universal interface)

## what are gnu core utils / unix toolchain? ##
- collection of tools for daily use
- build after (some aspects of) the unix principles
- avaible on most or all unix systems
- cmd \<input \>output
## big tools ##

#### grep ####
- find stuff
- can do regex

#### make ####
- build stuff using rules
- super fancy internal rules (for e.g. c)
- touring complete
- typical "make configure install"

#### sh ####
- interactive processor of commands
- unites toolchain
- cli ui (pls do not call it that xD )


#### ctags ####
- parses code to find defintions
- make definition searchable
- works for most languages

#### git ####
- versioning tool

#### gcc ####
- compiler
- designed for c but can do lot more know

#### man ####
- helpfile manager

#### gdb ####
- debugger
- designed for c
- can do lot more
## unixtoolchain with vim ##
- :set makeprg
- :set grepprg=rg --vimformat

#### use it with the builtin tools ####
- all external commands can be replaced
- use quickfix or specify alternative format
- can be changed for performance 
- can be changed for extra features (but watchout on other maschines)

#### use any tool with vim ####
- pipe output to files
- use fifo
- pipe content through commands
