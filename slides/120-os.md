## what are gnu core utils / unix toolchain?
- collection of tools for daily use
- build after (some aspects of) the unix principles
- avaible on most or all unix systems
- cmd \<input \>output

## never open
### git
- versioning tool

### make
- build stuff using rules
- super fancy internal rules (for e.g. c)
- touring complete
- typical "make configure install"

## always open
### sh
- interactive processor of commands
- just a t thin shell around your tool chain

### gcc
- compiler
- designed for c but can do a lot more

### man
- helpfile manager

### gdb
- debugger
- designed for c but can do a lot more

## small tools
### grep 
- find stuff
- can do regex

### ctags
- parses code to find defintions
- make definition searchable
- works for most languages

### awk
- messes around with files

### sed
- messes around with streams


## unixtoolchain with vim
- :set makeprg
- :set grepprg=rg --vimformat

### use it with the builtin tools
- all external commands can be replaced
- use quickfix or specify alternative format
- can be changed for performance 
- can be changed for extra features (but watchout on other maschines)

### use any tool with vim ####
- pipe output to files
- use fifo
- pipe content through commands
