# Macros #
- a series of actions which can be easily repeated
- no recursion allowed (see functions)
- can be used to enter snippets
- use q[a-z] to start recording macro into register
- use q again to stop macros
- use @[a-z] to execute macro (@@ to execute last used macro)

## How to they work? ##
- execute every keystroke from normal mode
- use q to write text into a register
- use @ to interpret register as commands!

## How to hack that? ##
- save snippets in files for easy access
- yank snippets into registers
- edit snippets by pasting and reyanking them

## search/command buffer ##
- use q: to access the command history
- use q/ to access the search history
- use normal vim commands to navigate in that buffer
- press enter to execute the current line as a command/search
